## Arcade Vehicle Controller(Archived)
This was the old copy of github.com/mrgarcialuigi/Arcade-Vehicle-Controller.  
He has a new version of this on the asset store. Please check it out if you've found this project helpful at all.

However, if github.com/mrgarcialuigi would like to have it removed, I will switch it to private.
The new car controller that he has for sale is much nicer, and has more useful features than this one.
